        <p>            
            This app is can be used to analyze the crab dataset originally contained in the R library MASS.
        </p>
        <p>
            This data frame contains the following columns:
            <li>"sp", which means species--"B" or "O" for blue or orange.</li>
            <li>"sex", as it says, the gender, Male or Female</li>
            <li>"FL", which means frontal lobe size (mm)</li>
            <li>"RW", which means rear width (mm)</li>
            <li>"CL", which means carapace length (mm)</li>
            <li>"CW", which means carapace width (mm)</li>
            <li>"BD", which means body depth (mm)</li>
        </p>    
        <p>The first tab shows the data, allowing the user to filter according to sex or species, being able to watch 
            only one subgroup or both.
        </p>
        <p>The second tab shows an interactive scatter plot, where the user can decide which variables to compare.
            It also allows the user to specify the discriminating color, sex or species.
            This last part is useful for the next problem, if we wanted to classify a crab based on a couple measures,
            with this plot we know that for either sex or species we will have two clearly different populations. 
        </p>
